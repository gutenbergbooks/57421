<p>Welcome to the National Air and Space
Museum, part of the Smithsonian family.
The flight of the Wrights in 1903 opened
the door to ever more rapid and powerful
ascents into the third dimension. This
country, putting its scientific and technical
talents to work, has produced an array of
fascinating and complex machines. Fortunately,
nearly all of the most significant
ones have been preserved, and a sampling
of them is included in this booklet. I hope
that you will enjoy it, and that it will add
to your understanding of what air and space
progress has meant to all of us.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>There is an obvious relationship between aeronautics and astronautics since the same
principles of physics apply and many materials and techniques of construction are
common. Nevertheless, in the decades following World War II, rocketry, guided missiles,
and space flights were rapidly developing a complex history and lore quite different from
that of aviation. Accordingly, in 1965, the Museum established a Department of
Astronautics parallel with a Department of Aeronautics.</p>
<p>At that time, artifacts in categories of rocket propulsion, guided missiles, and space-flight
programs were placed under curatorial control of the Astronautics Department. In
1967 the Smithsonian Institution and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
signed an agreement which provided for transfer of title to and custody of significant space
artifacts by the Museum after their technical need had passed. Through provisions of
this instrument the preservation and exhibit of this country&rsquo;s most important spacecraft,
rocket engines, launch vehicles, and missiles has been assured for posterity.</p>
<p>With the construction of the new Museum building on the Mall literally dozens of
exciting and fascinating astronautical artifacts have been acquired, some just a few
months before our opening in July 1976. All major artifacts on exhibit at the opening
are described herein with brief historical summaries.</p>

<p>Robert H. Goddard contributed the first
major astronautical breakthrough on
our way to space exploration&mdash;a liquid-propellant
rocket. A replica of the first
successful rocket of this type is displayed
in this hall as is Dr. Goddard&rsquo;s last sounding
rocket design.</p>
<p>The first of Dr. Goddard&rsquo;s successful
rockets was launched on March 16, 1926.
It traveled to an altitude of 12.5 meters (41
feet) powered by liquid oxygen and gasoline.
Its flight lasted 2.5 seconds with an
average speed in flight of about 96.6 kilometers
(60 miles) per hour. Part of the
rocket&rsquo;s nozzle was burned away during the
flight, and other parts were damaged by
ground impact; however, pieces of the
original rocket were reassembled and flown
again on April 3, 1926.</p>
<p>The last and most advanced of Dr. Goddard&rsquo;s
liquid-propellant rockets were those
tested between 1939 and 1941. This series
incorporated most of the basic principles
and elements later used in all long-range
rockets and space boosters. Design improvements
for this series included a fuel system
that used turbopumps to force propellants
from the tanks to the combustion chamber.
The rocket on display did not fly, because
a malfunction in the umbilical cord caused
the engine to shut down shortly after
ignition.</p>

National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
The 1941 rocket is from
Mrs. Robert H. Goddard.</p>

<p>A 29-meter (96-foot) rocket with 510,037
kilograms (1,124,440 pounds) of thrust
boosted <i>Sputnik 1</i> into orbit. The satellite&rsquo;s

with information on atmospheric and electron
densities. <i>Sputnik 1</i> transmitted temperature
data for 22 days before its

<p>The International Geophysical Year (1957-58)
provided the impetus for the first
official American satellite effort, designated
Project Vanguard in 1955. Vanguard was a
civilian effort that relied on a launch vehicle
built especially for the project&rsquo;s purposes.
The launch by the Soviet Union of <i>Sputnik
1</i> on October 4, 1957, caused the work on
Project Vanguard to go forward under great
pressure. When Vanguard Test Vehicle 3,
carrying the first American earth satellite,
exploded on its launch pad on December 6,
1957, United States prestige reached a low
point.</p>
<p>On January 31, 1958, <i>Explorer 1</i> became
the first successful American satellite. It
originated in Project Orbiter, a joint study
program of the U.S. Army and the Office of
Naval Research&mdash;a project that lapsed after
the 1955 decision to designate Vanguard as
the official American satellite effort. Following
the <i>Sputnik</i> success, the U.S. Army
Ballistic Missile Agency was instructed to
proceed with its satellite plans.</p>
<p><i>Explorer 1</i>&rsquo;s launch vehicle was a four-stage
Jupiter-C rocket designed, built, and
launched by the Army Ballistic Missile
Agency team headed by Wernher von
Braun. The satellite&rsquo;s instrumentation was
prepared by James Van Allen and George
Ludwig of the State University of Iowa
under project direction of the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, California Institute of
Technology.</p>
<p><i>Explorer 1</i> measured three phenomena&mdash;cosmic
ray and radiation levels (data that
led to the discovery of the earth&rsquo;s radiation
belts), the temperature in the vehicle
(important in the design of future spacecraft),
and the frequency of collisions with
micrometeorites. There was no provision for
data storage, and therefore the satellite
transmitted its information continually.</p>
<p><i>Explorer 1</i> was not the only orbiting
American satellite for long. In spite of
the early problems, Project Vanguard
succeeded in launching the second American
earth satellite on March 17, 1958.</p>

<p>The first successful interplanetary spacecraft
probed the environment of Venus,
Earth&rsquo;s closest neighbor. <i>Mariner 2</i>, working
flawlessly, swept by the hot and cloudy
planet at a closest approach of 34,834
kilometers (21,645 miles) on December 14,
1962.</p>
<p>The journey began with lift-off on August
27 from Cape Canaveral atop an Atlas
Agena-B launch vehicle. During the 109-day
trip to the planet, <i>Mariner</i>&rsquo;s on-board instruments
sampled the environment of
interplanetary space and telemetered information
to Earth stations. Ground-based
measurements of the Venerian surface
temperature were confirmed by the probe
to be around 425&deg; C (800&deg; F).</p>
<p><i>Mariner 2</i> detected no measurable magnetic
field or radiation belts, indicating that
Venus may have a very different history
than has Earth.</p>
<p><i>Mariner 2</i> passed out of tracking range
on January 4, 1963, when the spacecraft was
about 87 million kilometers (54 million
miles) from Earth. The probe is presently
in orbit around the Sun.</p>

February 20, 1962, from Cape Canaveral, Florida.</p>
</div>
<p>On the morning of February 20, 1962, a
29-meter (95-foot) Mercury Atlas launch
vehicle rose from Cape Canaveral carrying
John H. Glenn, Jr., in his Mercury spacecraft,
<i>Friendship 7</i>. This was the lift-off for
the first U.S.-manned orbital space flight.</p>
<p>In slightly more than 5 minutes the Atlas
accelerated <i>Friendship 7</i> to its orbital
velocity of 28,230 kilometers per hour
(17,540 miles per hour). Astronaut Glenn
completed three orbits in 4 hours, 55 minutes.
From the orbital path, which varied
between 160 and 260 kilometers (100 and
160 miles) above Earth, the first American
in orbit described the four sunsets he saw
and reported that he was able to distinguish
a ship&rsquo;s wake on the ocean below.</p>
<p>Mercury spacecraft had been used in two
previous manned suborbital flights which
proved that it was a safe vehicle for manned
space flights. Later orbital Mercury missions
demonstrated that man could live and
work in space. <i>Friendship 7</i>&rsquo;s flight tested
the performance of the pilot in weightless
conditions and the interaction of the human
pilot with the various automatic systems in
the spacecraft.</p>
<p><i>Friendship 7</i> reentered the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere
and splashed into the Atlantic Ocean
only 64 kilometers (40 miles) from the
planned site. Glenn and <i>Friendship 7</i> were
recovered by the U.S.S. <i>Noa</i> near Grand
Turk Island in the Bahamas.</p>
<p>The Mercury spacecraft consists of a
conical pressure section topped by a cylindrical
recovery-system section.</p>
<p>During flight, the Mercury spacecraft was
equipped with three 454-kilogram (1000-pound)
thrust solid-propellant retro-rockets
mounted in a package on the heat shield.
After the three rockets were fired to slow
the spacecraft, the retro-rocket package was
jettisoned.</p>

<p>Floating at the end of a gold &ldquo;umbilical
cord&rdquo; attached to the <i>Gemini 4</i> spacecraft,
Edward H. White II became the first American
to have only his space suit for protection
from the space environment. White
directed his movements during the historic
20-minute &ldquo;walk&rdquo; with a hand-held maneuvering
device, while command pilot James
A. McDivitt took pictures from within the
craft.</p>
<p>Launched June 3, 1965 atop 3 Titan II
booster, the <i>Gemini 4</i> spacecraft made 62
revolutions during the four-day flight.
Although <i>Gemini 4</i> failed to rendezvous
with the Titan II&rsquo;s second stage as planned,
because the stage fell away too rapidly to
catch, astronauts McDivitt and White did
demonstrate that the Spacecraft could be
moved in and out of its orbital plane with
ease.</p>
<p>The crew also photographed the Earth
successfully. The pictures brought back
from <i>Gemini 4</i> enhanced interest in photographic
surveys of Earth from space.</p>
<p><i>Gemini 4</i> splashed down in the Atlantic
at 12:12 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> (<span class="sc">EST</span>) on June 7, 1965.
McDivitt and White were on the deck of
recovery carrier U.S.S. <i>Wasp</i> in less than
one hour.</p>
<p>The spacecraft frame is titanium and it
is covered with steel and beryllium shingles.
Displayed here is the basic spacecraft which
includes the pressurized cabin vessel, the
heat shield at the base, and the cylindrical
reentry attitude-control system section on
the nose.</p>
<p>The heat shield is a curved section of
fiberglass honeycomb filled with a phenolic-epoxy
resin. During reentry, the craft&rsquo;s
kinetic energy was converted to heat by
friction with the atmosphere. The heat-shield
material melted and vaporized and
was blown away from the craft, carrying
the heat with it. This process is called
ablation.</p>
<p>The <i>Gemini</i> was a true spacecraft, capable
of maneuvering widely in space,
changing its configuration for different
phases of the flight, and allowing the two-man
crew to work both inside and outside
the craft.</p>

a solution of water and salts, a solution
believed to resemble the slightly salty water
of ancient seas. When heat and sparks were
added to the gases and salty water, a number

<p>This 1.2-meter (4-foot) diameter globe of
Mars was assembled from photographs
taken by <i>Mariner 9</i>, an unmanned spacecraft
that orbited the planet from November
14, 1971, until October 27, 1972. This globe
is the first such photomosaic ever made of
a planet.</p>
<p>Launched on May 30, 1971, <i>Mariner 9</i>
succeeded in photographing the entire
surface of the planet. In its 349 days of orbit
around Mars, <i>Mariner 9</i> circled the planet
698 times and took more than 7300
photographs.</p>
<p>In its highly elliptical orbit, <i>Mariner 9</i>
obtained a sequence of overlapping wide-angle
photographs. These were processed
by a computer to remove the known variations
in <i>Mariner 9</i> camera response and
geometric distortions, as well as to enhance
surface detail. The mosaic made from the
processed photographs is a pictorial presentation
of the Martian surface which shows
ridges and craters in the dark regions and
on the bright polar caps with equal clarity.
Surface features are in correct relationship
and perspective, with only a minimum of
shading difference between individual
photographs.</p>
<p>In assembling the photomosaic, each
picture was taped in place on the globe.
Then, the match of adjacent pictures was
assessed to determine where to trim the
edges so that sharp features would not
be intersected. The edges of each print were
feathered so that when the prints were
glued into place, the lines between pieces
were almost indistinguishable. The
complete globe received a thin
protective coating.</p>
<p>This globe and copies of it enable scientists
to study the geology and morphology
of Mars from a perspective never before
possible.</p>

assembled at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
California Institute of Technology, Pasadena,

<p><i>Mariner 10</i> returned closeup pictures of the
cloud cover around Venus and of Mercury&rsquo;s
sunbaked surface. <i>Mariner 10</i> was the first
spacecraft to photograph Mercury, the innermost
planet. The spacecraft&rsquo;s instruments
also measured particles, fields, and
radiation from these planets.</p>
<p><i>Mariner 10</i> flew by Venus on February
5, 1974, after a three-month, 240-million-kilometer
(150-million-mile) journey that
took the Spacecraft halfway around the Sun.
<i>Mariner 10</i> swung around the planet, taking
a variety of measurements and photographs
of the clouds that obscure the planet&rsquo;s face.
Using the planet&rsquo;s gravity to &ldquo;bend&rdquo; its
flight path, <i>Mariner 10</i> flew on toward
encounter with Mercury.</p>
<p>On March 29, 1974. <i>Mariner</i> sped across
the night side of the little planet closest to
the Sun. Only 703 kilometers (436 miles)
above the rugged surface, <i>Mariner</i>&rsquo;s cameras
captured the first closeup views of the
planet&rsquo;s daylight hemisphere. The pictures
show craters, scarps&mdash;cliffs nearly 3 kilometers
(2 miles) high and stretching as far
as 500 kilometers (300 miles) across the
surface&mdash;basins, and hilly furrowed terrain.</p>
<p>After providing our first glimpse of Mercury&rsquo;s
surface, <i>Mariner</i> raced on around
the Sun and back out across Venus&rsquo; orbit.
With some trajectory adjustments using
on-board thrusters. <i>Mariner</i> returned to
within 48,000 kilometers (30,000 miles) of
Mercury on September 21, 176 days after
the first encounter, again returning pictures
and data. <i>Mariner</i>&rsquo;s orbit brought it back
to the planet for a third pass in another 176
days. On-board propellant exhausted, the
spacecraft continues its orbit of the Sun
and innermost planet.</p>
<p><i>Mariner 10</i> is the first complex spacecraft
designed to travel to the inner reaches of
the solar system. At closest approach to the
Sun, the spacecraft received five times as
much light and heat as it did on leaving
Earth. Thus the solar panels, which collect
and convert solar radiation into electrical
energy for the spacecraft&rsquo;s instruments and
controls, were designed to tilt more and
more away from the sunlight as <i>Mariner</i>
approached the Sun.</p>
<p><i>Mariner</i> could transmit much more information
to Earth than earlier flyby spacecraft.
This higher data rate enabled the
craft to send back more live pictures of the
planets as it flew by them. Some information
was stored on magnetic tape for later
transmission. This capability permitted
<i>Mariner</i> to collect data when it was hidden
from Earth behind a planet, and send the
information when it emerged.</p>

<p>Robert Hutchings Goddard, the American
rocket pioneer, was one of the first to suggest
the use of the rocket to gather scientific
information from high altitudes. As seamen
use sounding lines to measure the depth of
unknown waters, so scientists use sounding
rockets to investigate the nature of our
atmosphere. As early as 1917, the Smithsonian
Institution agreed to fund Dr. Goddard&rsquo;s
studies. In 1926, he built and flew
the world&rsquo;s first successful liquid-propellant
rocket which rose to an altitude of 12.5
meters (41 feet) over a field in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>After the scientist received substantial
grants from the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim
Foundation, he established a
facility near Roswell, New Mexico, where
he built and tested a series of rockets and
engines between 1930 and 1942.</p>
<p>A-Series rockets&mdash;one on exhibit&mdash;were
flown during the summer of 1935, as part
of Dr. Goddard&rsquo;s program to develop
methods of stabilizing his rockets in vertical
flight. The principles he pioneered in this
area were among his greatest contributions
to the field of rocketry.</p>
<p>The greatest height reached by an A-Series
rocket was about 2130 meters (7000
feet) and the greatest speed in flight was
more than 1130 kilometers per hour (700
miles per hour).</p>

American sounding rocket to reach significant
altitude. The first WAC Corporal,
launched in 1944 from White Sands Proving
Ground in New Mexico, reached a height
of 71,600 meters (235,000 feet). The fin-stabilized
rocket was powered by a liquid-propellant
engine that burned a self-igniting
fuel and oxidizer combination. Use of these
propellants eliminated the need for an
ignition system. By March 1946, these rockets
had attained altitudes of over 72.4
kilometers (45 miles) with a booster. The
WAC Corporal was later used as a second
stage on a German V-2 rocket. This U.S.

<p>The Viking rocket family, numbering 14,
grew out of the Navy&rsquo;s efforts to develop an
upper atmosphere research program. With
enough time between launches to incorporate
modifications suggested by experience
with earlier Vikings, no two rockets of the
series were exactly alike; however, there
were two basic types of Vikings. The first
seven rockets were taller, thinner, and had
larger fins than those numbered 8-14; rockets
in the second set were heavier, with
fuel capacity greatly increased, and were
designed either to go higher than the early
Vikings or to carry heavier payloads to
the same altitude.</p>
<p>Viking&rsquo;s highest altitude was 254 kilometers
(158 miles) following a launch from
White Sands on May 24, 1954. Experiments
flown on these rockets measured air temperature,
density, pressure, and composition,
as well as providing cosmic and solar
radiation data.</p>
<p>One of the few failures in this program
was Viking 8, the first rocket of the second
set, which unexpectedly tore loose from the
launch stand while being test-fired.</p>
<p>Viking was conceived at the Naval Research
Laboratory, designed and produced
by the Glenn L. Martin Company of Baltimore,
Maryland, and powered by a liquid-propellant

<p>The concept of artificial earth satellites was
a logical extension of existing sounding-rocket
programs. The MOUSE, or Minimum
Orbital Unmanned Satellite of Earth, was
conceived in 1951 as the smallest possible
orbital vehicle capable of performing scientific
tasks. While the MOUSE was never
built or flown, it demonstrated what could
be accomplished by an orbiting vehicle of
modest size and weight.</p>
<p>The MOUSE would have weighed 45.4
kilograms (100 pounds). It was designed to
study cosmic rays, interplanetary dust, and
solar ultraviolet and X rays, with the instruments
attached to rods projecting from
either end. The satellite was to be powered
by solar cells.</p>
<p>MOUSE was conceived by Kenneth W.
Gatland, Anthony Kunesch, and Alan Dixon
of England. Dr. S. F. Singer of the University

</div>
<p>The first artificial earth satellites were
sometimes called &ldquo;long-playing rockets&rdquo;
because they carried the same instruments
and investigated the same problems as had
the sounding rockets. The great advantage
of the satellite was its ability to provide a
continuous flow of information for long
periods of time. The first science satellites
were the forerunners of later vehicles that
would demonstrate the direct benefits that
satellites could offer to such varied fields as
weather observation and communication.</p>
<p>The advent of the earth satellite provided
scientists with a new and valuable research
tool. Science satellites have been used for
such tasks as solar and astronomical observations,
biology experiments, or atmospheric
investigation. Explorer 1 (launched
January 31, 1958) and Vanguard 1
(launched March 17, 1958), the first American
earth satellites, carried scientific payloads
into space.</p>
<p>Project Vanguard&rsquo;s important contributions
to America&rsquo;s space program were the
creation of the minitrack tracking system,
the first use of silicon solar cells for electric
power in a satellite, as well as the discovery
that Earth is not quite round. The Vanguard
program drew to a close with the 1959
launch of Vanguard 3. This satellite studied
variations in solar and x-ray radiation and
the earth&rsquo;s magnetosphere. It also determined
air density in the upper atmosphere.</p>
<p>The mysteries of the near-earth space
environment drew <i>Explorer 6</i>, launched
August 7, 1959. <i>Explorer 6</i> instruments
measured radiation levels in the Van Allen
radiation belts, mapped the earth&rsquo;s magnetic
field, counted micrometeorites, and
studied the behavior of radio waves in space.
In addition, <i>Explorer 6</i> carried a scanning
device which returned the first complete
television cloud-cover picture of the earth&rsquo;s
surface.</p>

<p><i>Explorer 10</i>, launched on board a Thor-Delta
rocket on March 25, 1961, confirmed
the existence of the solar wind&mdash;the stream
of particles that carries the Sun&rsquo;s magnetic
field beyond the orbit of Earth. During the
satellite&rsquo;s planned 52 hours in orbit, it
relayed information on the relationship
between terrestrial and interplanetary magnetic
fields and the solar wind.</p>
<p>To continue the study of solar wind and
interplanetary magnetic fields, <i>Explorer 12</i>
was orbited by a Delta launch vehicle on
August 16, 1961. It was the first in a series
of satellites to study energetic particles in
space. These electrons and protons constitute
the earth&rsquo;s radiation belts and they
affect weather and other phenomena on
Earth.</p>
<p><i>Atmosphere Explorer-A</i> was the first of
NASA&rsquo;s aeronomy satellites. It was designed
to remain in operation three months, studying
the composition, density, pressure, and
temperature of the upper atmosphere. This
satellite discovered a belt of neutral helium
atoms around the Earth.</p>
<p>Deriving its name from a spirit in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
play, <i>The Tempest</i>, <i>Ariel 1</i> explored
the ionosphere, a region of electrically
charged air which begins about 40 kilometers
(25 miles) above the surface of
the Earth. Launched April 26, 1962, <i>Ariel</i>
was a cooperative venture between Great
Britain and the United States. It was both
the first British satellite and NASA&rsquo;s first
international satellite. The Royal Society&rsquo;s
British National Committee on Space
Research coordinated the experimental
program; NASA scientists and technicians
built the craft.</p>
<p>Two small scientific laboratories, called
Interplanetary Monitoring Platforms, were
launched in 1967 to study the solar wind
and other phenomena. IMP-E investigated
interplanetary magnetic fields in the vicinity
of the Moon. IMP-F investigated the interplanetary
magnetic field also, in addition to
the earth&rsquo;s magnetosphere and radiation
levels in space.</p>
<p>Interplanetary space between the Earth
and Venus was the subject area for <i>Pioneer
5</i>, launched March 11, 1960. The satellite
tested long-range communications systems,
developed methods for measuring astronomical
distances, studied the effects of
solar flares, and performed other tasks
before it went into orbit around the Sun.</p>
<p>With increasing interest in the earth&rsquo;s
space environment, a satellite was launched
on September 7, 1967, to investigate the
impact of space on biological processes.
<i>Biosatellite 2</i> was the second satellite in the
program of three such vehicles. Frog eggs,
plants, micro-organisms and insects were
placed in orbit to enable scientists to study
the combined effects of weightlessness,
artificially produced radiation, and the absence
of the normal day-night cycle on these
organisms. Following two days in space, the
capsule containing the experimental package
reentered the atmosphere and was
caught in mid-air by an Air Force recovery
aircraft.</p>

<p>Weather forecasts are important to everyone&mdash;in
planning whether or not to carry an
umbrella, when to plant crops, when to
evacuate riverbank areas. Nineteenth-century
American meteorologists relied on local
weather observations telegraphed to the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington and
then plotted on a large map of the nation
from which forecasts were prepared.</p>
<p>When <i>Tiros-1</i> returned the first global
cloud-cover picture in 1960, meteorologists
were on their way to more accurate forecasts.
Since the satellite pictures offered
more comprehensive weather data over a
larger geographic area, the identification of
weather patterns became more reliable.</p>
<p>While our knowledge of atmospheric
conditions is still imperfect, we have learned
to make reasonably accurate regional
weather forecasts and to identify and track
violent storms and hurricanes based on
satellite information.</p>
<p>The TIROS series (Television Infrared
Observations Satellites) were designed to
test the feasibility of weather observation
from orbit. The TIROS satellite on exhibit
was the prototype for the entire series of
vehicles. The prototype made eight trips to
the launch stand at Cape Kennedy, where
it was used to check communications and
handling procedures prior to the launch of
the scheduled TIROS. All 10 TIROS satellites
were successful. Launched between
April 1, 1960, and July 1, 1965, they carried
a variety of camera systems for experimental
purposes.</p>
<p>Nine TIROS Operational Satellites
(TOS) followed <i>TIROS 1-10</i>. Except for
the first TOS, these satellites flew in pairs
with one craft storing pictures on board for
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
later transmission to major receiving centers,
while the other broadcast its photographs
continuously to any ground station
within range. The satellite on display is
of the latter type. These vehicles were
launched between 1966 and 1969. They
were placed in near-polar orbits by reliable
Thor-Delta launch vehicles.</p>

<p>After launch, TOS vehicles were referred
to as ESSA satellites. ESSA was an acronym
both for Environmental Survey Satellite and
for the Environmental Science Service Administration,
the federal agency that operated
the spacecraft. This organization
became a part of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration which currently
has responsibility for operational
meteorological satellite programs.</p>

about surface temperatures on
the ground, at sea level, or at the cloud tops
obtained by scanning devices sensitive to

<p class="pcap"><b>38.</b> Ground inflation test on <i>Echo 1</i>, the world&rsquo;s first passive communications satellite.</p>
</div>
<p>Communications satellites can be grouped
into two broad categories. Passive vehicles
reflect signals from one ground station to
another. Active satellites accept ground signals
and either amplify and rebroadcast
them immediately or record messages for
later transmission.</p>
<p>The Echo satellite balloons typified the
passive category of communications spacecraft.
These satellites &ldquo;bounced&rdquo; radio signals
from one ground station to another.
Uninflated Echo payloads were carried into
orbit packed in special storage containers.
When released in space, the balloon was
inflated by chemicals packed inside which
subliminated to produce inflating gas. The
mylar plastic skin of the satellite was sandwiched
between two layers of aluminum
foil. <i>Echo 2</i>&mdash;on display&mdash;included a system
for releasing gas over a long period of time
to maintain the satellite&rsquo;s spherical shape.
Launched January 25, 1964, <i>Echo 2</i> was the
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
first satellite used for communication experiments
between the United States and
the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Project West Ford, launched May 9,
1963, was a unique experiment in passive
satellite communications. It was not a solid
vehicle, but a series of 400-million tiny individual
copper filaments called dipoles.
The dipoles formed a reflective layer some
64,300 kilometers (40,000 miles) long, 32
kilometers (20 miles) thick, and 32 kilometers
(20 miles) wide. The distance between
the individual dipoles averaged 536
meters (one-third mile). The West Ford
experiment proved disappointing, and advances
in the design of active communications
satellites made further experiments of
this nature unnecessary.</p>
<p><i>Oscar 1</i> (Orbital Satellite Carrying Amateur
Radio) was conceived, designed, and
constructed by American amateur radio
&ldquo;hams.&rdquo; Launched as a &ldquo;piggyback&rdquo; satellite
on December 12, 1963, Oscar transmitted
a series of Morse code dots spelling
&ldquo;hi.&rdquo; The message was picked up by 5000
operators in 28 nations during the 18 days
of transmission. Oscar investigated radio
propagation phenomena in space on that
portion of the radio frequency spectrum
allocated to amateur radio (144-146 megaherz).</p>
<p>Testing the use of a &ldquo;delayed-repeater&rdquo;
satellite in global military communications,
<i>Courier 1-B</i> was placed in a high-altitude
orbit on October 4, 1960. The craft accepted
and stored messages as it passed over one
ground station, then replayed them on
command.</p>
<p><i>Relay</i>, another active repeater satellite,
was placed in orbit on December 13, 1962.
<i>Relay</i> carried communications experiments
to test a variety of relay equipment&mdash;including
that for photofacsimile, teleprinter, and
data transmission. During its 25-month lifespan,
<i>Relay 1</i> introduced the nations of the
world to satellite communication. A second,
improved <i>Relay</i> was launched in 1964.</p>

<p>The world&rsquo;s first commercial communications
satellite was called &ldquo;Early Bird,&rdquo; or
INTELSAT 1. Built a decade ago by
Hughes Aircraft Company for Communications
Satellite Corporation (COMSAT),
Early Bird could transmit simultaneously
on 240 two-way channels for telephone,
telegraph, or data transmission. Transatlantic
telephone circuit capability increased
by 50 percent once Early Bird went
into orbit on April 6, 1965. Although the
craft had a life expectancy of 18 months, it
operated satisfactorily in full-time service
for more than three and one-half years.</p>
<p>INTELSAT 2 introduced multipoint communications
between earth stations in the
Northern and Southern hemispheres. With
almost twice the power of Early Bird,
INTELSAT 2 proved particularly important
as communications support for the Apollo
missions to the Moon.</p>
<p>INTELSAT 2 established a global network
of three satellites that was effective in
linking two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s people in
one communications chain. The first of the
series was launched on January 11, 1967.
These spacecraft were designed and manufactured
by the Hughes Aircraft Company
for Intelsat, Inc., and had a design lifetime
of three years.</p>
<p>INTELSAT 3 was a series of five communications
satellites which provided
global coverage for the first time. This
INTELSAT had a capacity of 2400 voice,
data, facsimile, and telegraph circuits, plus
four television channels and had a design
lifetime of five years.</p>
<p>The satellite featured a de-spun antenna
which remained pointed at a particular area
of the globe, while the body of the satellite
spun around it. It was the first commercial

<p>The lunar module is one of twelve built
for the Apollo moon-landing program.
Although this one never flew because an
earlier test flight was completely successful,
two-stage lunar modules like this one have
been used for each manned moon landing.</p>
<p>Lunar modules do not have to be streamlined
for flights through the vacuum of
space or to withstand reentry. The lunar
module (LM) lifts off from Earth enclosed
in a compartment of the Saturn 5 launch
vehicle, below the command-service module
that houses the astronauts. The command
module pulls the LM from its storage area
once the spacecraft are on their way to the
Moon, and the two travel together until they
arrive in lunar orbit.</p>
<p>When the crew is ready to land, two of
the three astronauts enter the LM and undock
it, leaving the third to pilot the command
module. After touchdown on the
Moon, the astronauts exit through the door
above the ladder.</p>
<p>The silver and black ascent stage, containing
the astronauts&rsquo; pressurized compartment
and the clusters of rockets that control
the spacecraft, fits on top of the shiny gold
descent stage that actually touches down
on the Moon. The descent stage contains a
main, centrally located rocket engine. This
segment of the craft remains on the Moon
as the crew lifts off in the ascent stage to
rejoin the command module.</p>
<p>After the crew transfers to the command
module, the ascent stage is also left behind
as the three crew members start their return
journey.</p>
<p>The LM is displayed just as it would look
during a moon-landing mission. The gold
and black materials insulate the spacecraft&rsquo;s
inner structure from temperature extremes
and protect it from micrometeoroids. Thin
sheets of both materials are used in &ldquo;blankets&rdquo;
to accomplish the necessary protection
in a foreign environment.</p>
<p>The black material is heat-resistant
nickel-steel alloy. Each sheet is only .002
millimeters (1/12,000 of an inch) thick.
These absorb heat and radiate it back into
the blackness of space.</p>
<p>The shiny gold material on the descent
stage is aluminum that is thinly coated over
plastic film. The thin sheets of plastic and
aluminum are used in blankets of up to 25
layers for protection and insulation of the
spacecraft.</p>

<p>The Lunar Orbiter project was initiated in
1963 as part of the U.S. Apollo program to
land men on the Moon during the decade
of the nineteen sixties.</p>
<p>Lunar Orbiter&rsquo;s primary mission was to
take and transmit both wide-angle and
closeup images of the Moon. Lunar Orbiters
photographed many areas of scientific interest
and provided general photographic
coverage of much of the moon&rsquo;s surface.
These pictures were then used to select the
best landing sites for the first manned lunar
landings. Orbiters also showed that the
moon&rsquo;s gravitational field permitted stable
orbits.</p>
<p><i>Lunar Orbiter 1</i> was launched atop an
Atlas-Agena D rocket on August 10, 1966.
The last in the project, <i>Lunar Orbiter 5</i>,
was launched on August 1, 1967. All five
missions were successful.</p>
<p>The first three missions were similar. After
each launch, the Agena stage&rsquo;s booster
engine was fired to send the spacecraft on
a 90-hour coasting trajectory to the Moon,
about 386,160 kilometers (240,000 miles)
distant.</p>
<p>As the spacecraft neared the Moon, its
on-board engine was fired as a retrorocket
to slow the <i>Orbiter</i> and permit it to go into
orbit around the Moon.</p>
<p>The closest approach to the Moon in each
orbit was about 45 kilometers (28 miles),
and the spacecraft swung out to about 1850
kilometers (1150 miles) from the Moon.</p>
<p>Photography was conducted while the
<i>Orbiter</i> was near the lunar surface. Lunar
photography for the Apollo Program
landing-site selection was completed by the
first three Lunar Orbiters. Each was then
intentionally crashed into the Moon to prevent
it from interfering with later missions.</p>
<p>The last two Lunar Orbiters were used
for scientific photography of the Moon. Both
were placed into polar orbits so that they
could photograph all of the sunlit areas of
the Moon.</p>
<p>Each Lunar Orbiter carried a camera
with both a telephoto and a wide-angle lens.
The telephoto lens was capable of resolving
objects on the lunar surface as small as 91.4
centimeters (three feet) in diameter. The
wide-angle lens could resolve objects as small
as 7.6 meters (25 feet) in diameter. The
photographic images were converted to
electrical signals for transmission to Earth.</p>
<p>The Lunar Orbiter project was a complete
success. All spacecraft operated properly,
photographing a total of more than 36-million
square kilometers (14-million square
miles) of the moon&rsquo;s surface.</p>
<p>Prime contractor for the Lunar Orbiter
program was the Boeing Company. Principal
subcontractors were Eastman Kodak
Company and RCA.</p>
<p>The Lunar Orbiter in the National Air
and Space Museum&rsquo;s collection was used
for thermal testing of spacecraft systems.</p>

<p>The American pioneer of astronautics, Robert
H. Goddard (1882-1945) not only outlined
the physical principles that would
govern space flight, but he also constructed
and tested many rocket engines, airframes,
control devices, and guidance mechanisms
between 1926 and 1942.</p>
<p>Goddard held a doctorate in physics, and
was a professor at Clark University, Worcester,
Massachusetts. The Smithsonian
Institution began funding Goddard&rsquo;s experiments
as early as 1917 and published
his first major work, <i>A Method of Reaching
Extreme Altitudes</i>, in 1919.</p>
<p>Goddard was not only a trained scientist,
but a talented and ingenious engineer as
well. On March 16, 1926, he launched the
world&rsquo;s first liquid-propellant rocket. By
1930, he had established a rocket test facility
at Mescalero Ranch, near Roswell,
New Mexico. Here, he conducted research,
funded by the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim
Foundation, on rocket power plants,
pumps and fuel systems, control mechanisms,
and other vital elements of the
modern rocket.</p>
<h3>The Rocket of May 4, 1926</h3>
<p>This vehicle is the oldest surviving liquid-propellant
rocket in the world. Built of
parts employed in the first liquid-propellant
rocket launched on March 16, 1926, the
engine was moved from the nose of the
vehicle to the rear for the May 4 trial. Other
changes were introduced to reduce the
weight of the rocket to 2.5 kilograms (5.5
pounds). The motor burned gasoline and
liquid oxygen.</p>
<p>The alcohol burner under the liquid
oxygen tank was inadvertently not ignited,
causing the May 4 attempted launch to fail.
A second test on May 5 also proved unsuccessful.
However, the rocket engine was
fired on both occasions.</p>

<p>The May 4 rocket is from Mrs. Robert H.
Goddard and the Daniel and Florence

<div class="img" id="fig48">
<img src="images/p20.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="556" />
<p class="pcap"><b>47.</b> <i>The Bombardment of Algiers</i>, 1816. Congreve rockets in use.</p>
</div>
<p>The rebirth of European interest in military
rocketry can be traced to the English conquest
of India during the late 18th century.
William Congreve, an artillery expert, was
intrigued by the tactical success of the
Indian war rockets. He began a research
program in 1804 that led to the development
of a metal-cased, stick-guided artillery
rocket that could be fired in barrages
against enemy troops. The rocket carried
incendiary or explosive warheads.</p>
<p>The 14.5-kilogram (32-pound) Congreve
war rocket models on display show the early
side-mounting of the stabilizing guide stick
and the later (1815) design in which the
guide stick was center-mounted to give
greater accuracy. Congreve rockets played
an important role during the Napoleonic
Wars and the War of 1812.</p>
<p>The experimental 45.4-kilogram (100-pound)
Congreve incendiary rocket was
developed as a siege weapon for use against
fortresses or entrenched enemy positions,
although it is not known to have been used
in combat. The 6.7-meter (22-foot) guide
stick screwed together and fitted to the side
of the projectile before firing. Like the
smaller Congreve rockets, it could be
launched from a frame or earthen embankment.</p>
<p>William Hale was an English engineer
and ordnance expert who made cumbersome
guide sticks obsolete with the introduction
of spin stabilization to rocketry. Hale&rsquo;s first
design of a stickless, or rotary, rocket was
patented in 1844. Although the 5.4-kilogram
(12-pound) rocket was used during the
Mexican War (1846-1847) and the Civil
War, Hale subsequently refined it because
the rocket had a tendency to oscillate in the
air following exhaustion of the propellant.</p>
<p>Hale&rsquo;s intermediate pattern rocket of
1862&mdash;on display&mdash;was never produced,
giving way in 1865 to a rocket weighing 11
kilograms (24 pounds) with a maximum
range of 2012 meters (2200 yards) when
fired from a 4.6-meter (15-foot) elevation.
The propellant burned for 5 to 10 seconds,
producing an estimated maximum thrust
of 136 kilograms (300 pounds).</p>
<p>The American version of the Hale rocket
has two sets of gas nozzles. The major aperture
on the base of the case allowed the
propellant gases to escape. The smaller
holes above the rocket&rsquo;s midpoint are
angled; the exhaust gases spin the projectile,
stabilizing it during flight. Hale rocket
designs were employed by both sides during
the Civil War.</p>

<p>The American Rocket Society (ARS) was
the first organization in the United States
dedicated to rocket research. The society
was founded in New York City in March
1930 by G. E. Pendray and David Laser.
The first successful ARS rocket was launched
on May 13, 1933. The group continued to
build and test rocket engines until the outbreak
of World War II. After 1945, the ARS
became a professional society for engineers
involved in astronautics. The ARS joined
with other aeronautical engineering groups
to form the American Institute of Aeronautics
and Astronautics in 1963.</p>
<p>The first liquid-propellant rocket engines
built by the American Rocket Society were
machined from blanks of heat-resistant,
cast-aluminum alloy. Engine No. 1 powered
the first two rockets designed and constructed
by the ARS. It featured combustion
chamber walls 12.7 millimeters (&frac12; inch)
thick and burned liquid oxygen and gasoline
to produce a thrust of 27.22 kilograms
(60 pounds). Liquid oxygen was pressurized
by partial evaporation, while bottled
nitrogen forced gasoline from the tank to
the engine.</p>
<p>ARS Engine No. 4, like its predecessors,
was mounted in the nose, rather than the
tail, of the rocket. The engine featured a
single combustion chamber and four nozzles.
The nozzles directed the jet gases to
the rear and slightly away from the top of
the gasoline tank on which the engine was
mounted. The rocket powered by this engine
was tested on September 9, 1934. It rose
several hundred feet, at which point one of
the nozzles burned out, bringing the flight
to a close. In 1938, ARS member James
Wyld suggested a cooling system whereby
propellants circulate through a jacket surrounding
the combustion chamber. Engines
using this system are termed &ldquo;regeneratively
cooled.&rdquo; The first Wyld rocket motor tested
developed 41 kilograms (90 pounds) of
thrust for 13&frac12; seconds. It proved so successful
that Wyld and other members of the
ARS founded Reaction Motors, Inc., to
produce and sell rocket engines based on
this design.</p>
<p>The performance of motors developed by
the ARS prior to World War II was measured
on a test stand with built-in fuel and
oxidizer tanks and bottled nitrogen gas. The
engine was mounted on a carriage, and
connected to the stand&rsquo;s propellant tanks
by flexible metal hoses. Thrust was indicated
on a pressure gauge. The stand was
first used in 1938.</p>

level. It burned liquid oxygen and a grade
of aviation kerosene. The combustion
chambers were gimbal mounted to allow
them to swivel, controlling the missile trajectory
during the powered phase of flight.

<p>During the first twenty years of the space
age, all launch vehicles were propelled by
solid or liquid chemical rockets; however,
nuclear and electric rocket motors are
needed to provide the higher thrusts and
velocities required for possible future manned
journeys to other planets. Robert H.
Goddard, the American rocket pioneer, was
the first to suggest the possibility of electric
rocket motors, but it was not until 1964
that electric rockets were actually tested in
space.</p>
<p>Two types of ion engines represent the
most fully developed electric propulsion
systems. In contact ion engines, a propellant
gas (mercury or cesium, for example) is
ionized, or given an electrical charge, by
passage through a hot porous metal. The
resulting ions are accelerated out of the
engine by an electrical field. The charged
ions are neutralized as they approach the
nozzle to form an exhaust beam that imparts
the thrust. Bombardment ion engines rely
on the bombardment of the propellant gas
by electrons from a cathode, or negative
electrode, to create ions. The ions are accelerated
from the engine in the same manner
as in the contact ion engine.</p>
<h3>A Cesium Ion Rocket Engine</h3>
<p>This small contact ion engine produces
.0009 kilogram (.002 pound) of thrust by
passing vaporized cesium through hot tungsten.
On Earth this amount of power is
scarcely enough to lift a one-carat jewel an
inch off a table, but in the frictionless vacuum
of space, it is sufficient to provide
attitude control for satellites. It can also
accelerate a spacecraft to high interplanetary
velocities by operating continuously for
thousands of hours.</p>
<p>An ion engine of this type was first tested
in space in 1964. On that occasion, it provided
.0009 kilogram (.002 pound) of thrust
for 2 hours, 10 minutes. It was able to
control the attitude of the attached instrument
package.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>57.</b> The Project Orion test vehicle was used to explore the feasibility of a unique type of propulsion which utilized successive
nuclear explosions behind the rear pusher plate.</p>
</div>
<p>Project Orion was an attempt to solve the
problems of propulsion for long-term manned
journeys to other planets by creating
an engine that would use successive nuclear
explosions to propel very large space vehicles.
The Orion spacecraft was designed
to carry many small nuclear explosive systems
which would be ejected sequentially
from the rear of the vehicle. These units
would explode some distance behind the
spacecraft. The expanding debris, in the
form of high-velocity, high-density plasma,
would strike a pusher plate at the rear of
the Orion vehicle.</p>
<p>Work on Project Orion was halted in
1963 when the Limited Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty, which prohibited atmospheric tests
of the propulsion system, was signed.</p>
<p>The Project Orion Test Vehicle&mdash;on
display&mdash;demonstrated the basic principle
of intermittent thrust from explosive
charges. Test data provided by this model
would have assisted engineers in developing
the full-scale spacecraft.</p>
<p>The test vehicle carried five high-explosive
plastic charges which were ejected
from the rear of the craft. Compressed
nitrogen powered the ejection system. Each
charge was attached to the vehicle by a
.9-meter (3-foot) cord. A microswitch
exploded the individual packages. The
Project Orion Test Vehicle was first flown
successfully in October 1959.</p>

<h3>The Plug-Nozzle Rocket Engine</h3>
<p>Although this engine is a liquid-propellant
rocket, it substitutes a series of small combustion
chambers and nozzles for the traditional
single large chamber and nozzle to
achieve additional thrust. This innovative
combustion system features chambers and
nozzles mounted on an annular ring at the
base of the engine. Thrust is derived from
the expansion of the exhaust gases against
a large segmented plug in the center of the
engine. Flight control is achieved by varying
the amount of propellant introduced
into the individual chamber sections. The
engine on exhibit burned liquid oxygen and
kerosene to provide a thrust of 22,680 kilograms
(50,000 pounds).</p>
<p>The plug-nose rocket engine was developed

<p class="pcap"><b>58.</b> Astronaut John Glenn is assisted with his suiting-up.</p>
</div>
<p>Modern space suits are direct descendants
of the simple &ldquo;pressure suits&rdquo; designed as
early as 1907 for deep-sea divers. In 1911
an English respiratory physiologist, J. S.
Haldane, proposed the use of an oxygen
pressurized suit for ascent to high altitudes.
The first U.S. patent was granted for a pressure
suit in 1918.</p>
<p>Through the early 1960s, all such suits
were pressure containers. Project Mercury
astronauts wore suits adapted from the U.S.
Navy MK-IV pressure suit. It consisted of
an inner layer of neoprene-coated fabric
and a restraint layer of aluminized nylon
fabric. The garment design provided a fair
degree of mobility, although the suit could
not bend with the full hinge motion of the
human elbow or knee because it folded in
at the joints, reducing overall volume and
increasing internal pressure. The Mercury
suit would have been pressurized only if
spacecraft cabin pressure had been lost.</p>
<p>Space suits require a great deal of sophistication.
They must meet many vital criteria,
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
including low leakage, thermal control,
comfort, stowage, and protection from
micrometeoroid strikes.</p>
<p><i>Gemini 4</i> was the first American mission
to explore the problems of man functioning
outside his spacecraft, with only his space
suit for protection. This extravehicular activity
required the space suit to be a prime
system rather than a precautionary measure.</p>

The suit&rsquo;s 21 layers are materials such as

specialized materials protected the astronauts
from the extreme temperatures of

stainless steel cloth to protect against
abrasion. Suits had to fit the wearers so
precisely that 67 anthropometric measurements
were required of each astronaut.</p>

the following equipment was worn under
the suit: a fecal containment system for
emergency containment of solid-waste material;
a liquid-cooling garment; a bio-belt
assembly, urine collection and transfer
system. Together with a portable life-support
system, this constituted the complete
Environmental Mobility Unit (EMU).</p>
<p>The liquid-cooling garment consists of
an outer layer of nylon spandex material, a
network of polyvinyl-chloride tubing, and
a nylon-chiffon comfort liner. Even spacing
of the plastic tubing permitted the efficient
transfer of body heat to the cooling liquid
(water) as it circulated through the suit.</p>
<p>The bio-belt assembly, worn over the
liquid-cooling garment, contains preamplifiers
for sensors placed next to the skin.
The sensors acquired electrical signals
which determined respiration rate and
electrocardiograms of the astronauts. The
preamplifiers relayed the signals to the
spacecraft telemetry system for transmission
to Earth.</p>
<p>The urine collection and transfer assembly
provided for emergency containment
of liquid waste when spacecraft facilities
were not available. Liquid waste was subsequently
transferred from the collection
assembly to the spacecraft waste-management
system.</p>
<p>The portable life-support system (PLSS)
created and maintained a livable atmosphere
inside an astronaut&rsquo;s space suit during
activity on the lunar surface. Worn as
a backpack, the PLSS could be used for as
long as four hours at a time.</p>
<p>The PLSS supplied oxygen for breathing
purposes, suit pressurization, and ventilation.
It also removed contaminants from
oxygen circulating through the suit and
supplied water and oxygen for body cooling.
Conversion of exhaled carbon dioxide into
oxygen was accomplished through a lithium-hydroxide
cartridge also contained in the
PLSS. An emergency supply of oxygen was
contained in the oxygen purge system
mounted on top of the PLSS.</p>

<p>The German V-2, originally designated A-4,
represents the beginning of modern rocketry.
The V-2 was the first proof that large
rockets of the sort described by the space-flight
pioneers of the early twentieth century
could be successfully built and flown.
It was also the forerunner of the intercontinental
ballistic missile system.</p>
<p>Developed by a team of engineers working
under the direction of Dr. Wernher von
Braun at Peenemunde, Germany, the V-2
work laid the foundation for the Redstone
missile through the Saturn series of space
launch vehicles.</p>
<p>Four-thousand V-2s were fired against
Allied targets in England and on the continent
in 1944 and 1945. After World War
II, captured V-2 rockets were used to train
American technicians in missile launch
procedures and to carry the first payloads
of scientific instruments into the upper
atmosphere in the United States.</p>
<p>The operational V-2 rocket structure
consisted of three sections. The nose housed
the warhead and control mechanisms. The
fuel tanks carried liquid oxygen and alcohol
propellants. The rocket engine, turbopumps,
and control surfaces were contained in the
tail section.</p>
<p>Jet deflector vanes positioned in the
stream of exhaust gases and external vanes
maintained attitude and directional control

ground-to-air rocket was fin-stabilized, and
controlled by radio. The flight of the two-stage

warhead was housed at the rear of the sustainer
stage. Exhaust gases were expelled
through six nozzles located between the
main fins.</p>
<p>The program was abandoned in December

first mission. The Airlock Module was attached
to the OWS and passage to the
module was accomplished through a hatch
which connected the module to the interior
of the workshop. When an astronaut entered
the module, he would vent the atmosphere
of the module into space. When the pressure
in the airlock reached zero, the crew
member could open the outer hatch and
float out into space.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>77.</b> Artist conception of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project rendezvous.</p>
</div>
<p>On May 24, 1972, President Richard Nixon
and Aleksey Kosygin, Chairman of the
USSR Council of Ministers, signed an
agreement &ldquo;concerning cooperation in the
exploration and use of outer space for
peaceful purposes.&rdquo; The signing represented
a formal endorsement of negotiations
that had been held between the two nations
over several years. The agreement established
the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project
(ASTP) to develop and fly a standardized
docking system &ldquo;to enhance the safety of
manned flight in space and to provide the
opportunity for conducting joint scientific
missions in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On July 15, 1975, the afternoon countdown
for the Soviet launch was completed
and <i>Soyuz</i> lifted off from the Baykonur complex
near Tyuratum in Central Asia, some
3200 kilometers (2000 miles) southeast of
Moscow. <i>Soyuz</i> carried cosmonauts Alexey
Leonov and Valeriy Kubasov.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of <i>Apollo</i>&rsquo;s larger fuel
supply for maneuvering, <i>Apollo</i> followed
<i>Soyuz</i> into orbit 7&frac12; hours later. <i>Apollo</i> was
launched atop a Saturn 1B from Kennedy
Space Center, Florida.</p>
<p>After careful maneuvering, the two craft
linked up around noon on July 18. Some 225
kilometers (140 miles) above Earth, the
astronauts and cosmonauts visited each
other&rsquo;s craft, performed joint experiments,
and made further tests of the new docking
system.</p>
<p>Following the undocking Saturday,
<i>Apollo</i> fired its engines briefly and moved
away from <i>Soyuz</i>. <i>Soyuz</i> descended from
orbit and landed in the south-central USSR
early Monday morning, July 21.</p>
<p>Astronauts Stafford, Slayton, and Brand
remained in orbit conducting research
and making science demonstrations. Splashdown
into the Pacific Ocean occurred in
late afternoon on Thursday, July 24.</p>
<p>The historic ASTP mission was accomplished
by using existing systems and a new
docking module. The <i>Apollo</i> spacecraft was
made available when the lunar-landing
program was curtailed. Since the command
module was built with a docking system
designed to work only with U.S. spacecraft,
a method of incorporating the new docking
system had to be devised.</p>
<p>A second important problem was the difference
between the spacecraft atmospheres.
The <i>Apollo</i> used a pure oxygen
atmosphere at about one-third of the
atmospheric pressure on earth&rsquo;s surface;
<i>Soyuz</i> used a nitrogen-oxygen mixture at
normal atmospheric pressure. To permit
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
crews to pass from <i>Soyuz</i> to <i>Apollo</i> without
suffering from the &ldquo;bends&rdquo; (a painful
condition experienced when nitrogen gas
bubbles form in the body fluids), engineers
had to design an airlock to equalize
the pressure.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>81.</b> Three chase planes salute the M2-F3 wingless lifting body following one of its rocket-powered flights. The blunt-nosed
M2-F3 achieves its aerodynamic lift from the shape of its body.</p>
</div>
<p>This wingless craft is called a lifting body,
because it derives its lift from the fuselage
rather than from wings. Removing the
wings reduces the weight of the craft, but
adds significant control problems. The lifting
body concept was developed early in
the last decade to explore the problems of
aerodynamic heating and vehicle control
during reentry from earth orbit. These are
the problems that will be especially critical
in the space shuttle of the 1980s.</p>
<p>The M2-F3 tested flight behavior of wingless
craft over a wide range of speeds.</p>
<p>The M2-F3&rsquo;s forerunner, the M2-F2,
made 16 flights&mdash;all unpowered&mdash;between
July 1966 and May 1967. On May 10, it
crashed on landing, partly due to control
instability. The craft was rebuilt, and the
center fin was added. This modification
effectively solved the control problem, and
the new craft, designated M2-F3, logged 27
more flights by December 1972. Some of the
M2-F3&rsquo;s flights were powered by a 3630-kilogram
(8000-pound) thrust rocket which
boosted the craft to a higher altitude.</p>
<p>The M2-F3 was launched from a B-52
bomber at a height of about 13,300 meters
(45,000 feet) and a usual speed of 730 kilometers
(450 miles) per hour. The maximum
altitude achieved was 21,800 meters (71,500
feet). The M2-F3&rsquo;s record speed was
1718 kilometers (1066 miles) per hour.
The M2-F3 was built by Northrop.</p>

1965, carrying astronauts Frank Borman
and James Lovell, Jr., into a two-week flight.
<i>Gemini 6</i> and <i>7</i> accomplished the first manned
rendezvous in space. It was an historic
flight for the United States&rsquo; manned space
program and an important step in the preparation
for the Apollo lunar flights.</p>
<p>The story of the <i>Gemini 7/6</i> mission had
begun two months earlier. The October
launch of <i>Gemini 6</i> had to be delayed when
<i>Gemini 6</i>&rsquo;s Agena target vehicle failed to
reach orbit. It was then decided that
<i>Gemini 6</i> would attempt to rendezvous with
<i>Gemini 7</i>. Eight days after the launch of
<i>Gemini 7</i>, <i>Gemini 6</i> was ready. But once
again, the launch had to be delayed&mdash;this
time an electrical plug became detached
from the Titan booster prematurely, shutting
down the engines. Finally, on December
15, <i>Gemini 6</i>&rsquo;s Titan II launch vehicle
lifted off. <i>Gemini 6</i> began a 6-hour chase to
catch <i>Gemini 7</i>, which was in a near-circular
orbit 300 kilometers (186 miles) high.</p>
<p><i>Gemini 6</i>&rsquo;s launch put it 1175 kilometers
(730 miles) behind <i>Gemini 7</i> in an orbit
which varied from 161 to 272 kilometers
(100 to 169 miles) in height. By flying in a
lower altitude orbit, <i>Gemini 6</i> astronauts
Wally Schirra and Thomas Stafford circled
the Earth at a higher velocity, slowing
down as they moved to match speed with
<i>Gemini 7</i> at the higher orbit. Finally,
Schirra jockeyed the <i>Gemini 6</i> spacecraft
to within 30 centimeters (1 foot) from
<i>Gemini 7</i>.</p>
<p>They stayed in formation for four revolutions
while all four pilots practiced maneuvering.
Then <i>Gemini 6</i> broke off and reentered,
splashing down on December 16,
1965.</p>
<p><i>Gemini 7</i> went on to complete its 14-day
mission which set a record for the longest
U.S.-manned space flight which stood until
the first Skylab mission. <i>Gemini 7</i> splashed

</div>
<p>The <i>Skylab 4</i> command module ferried the
crew of the last Skylab mission&mdash;astronauts
Gerald P. Carr, Edward G. Gibson, and
William R. Pogue. The <i>Skylab 4</i> crew lived
in the Skylab for 84 days, from November
16, 1973, to February 8, 1974.</p>
<p>In flight, the Apollo command module
operated with a service module&mdash;an equipment
section, 7.4 meters (24 feet) long and
4 meters (13 feet) in diameter&mdash;attached
to the command module. The service module
provided electrical power, oxygen, and
water for the command module for most of
a typical flight.</p>
<p>In addition, the service module contained
the 9300-kilogram (20,500-pound) thrust
Service Propulsion System, an engine capable
of being throttled and restarted.
During Apollo lunar flights, the engine
provided thrust for mid-course trajectory
changes and boosted the command/service
module combination out of lunar orbit and
back to Earth. The service module was jettisoned
just before reentry into the earth&rsquo;s
atmosphere.</p>
<p>During reentry, the command module&rsquo;s
exterior was subjected to temperatures of
around 2800&deg;C (5000&deg;F). The command
module is covered with an ablative heat
shield composed of a phenolic epoxy resin
in a fiberglass honeycomb structure. As
friction with the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere caused
the heat shield to char and vaporize, the
heat was carried away from the spacecraft.
The heat shield varies in thickness from 7
centimeters (2.75 inches) at the base to .6
centimeter (.25 inch) at the forward section.
Total weight of the heat shield is about
1400 kilograms (3000 pounds).</p>
<p>The prime contractor for the Apollo
Command Module was North American
Rockwell Corporation.</p>
<hr />
<p>The command module is from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>91.</b> A sample of vesicular basalt, produced by lunar volcanism 3.7 billion years ago, in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. Devices
record size and orientation of the rock. The cavities in this sample were formed by gases escaping from the still-molten rock.
This sample is 13.5 centimeters (5.5 inches) long. A fragment of this lunar rock is on display in the &ldquo;Apollo to the Moon&rdquo; gallery.</p>
</div>
<p>During the six Apollo program moon landings,
astronauts collected and returned to
Earth samples of the lunar surface. The
samples were collected both from the flat
maria regions&mdash;great basins created by
ancient meteoric impacts and later filled
with lava from the moon&rsquo;s interior&mdash;and
from the highland regions.</p>
<p>Subsequent analysis of the samples has
indicated that the moon&rsquo;s surface is largely
composed of three kinds of rock.</p>
<p>Basalt, the rock of the maria regions, was
formed as lavas from the interior of the
Moon welled to the surface, filled the great
meteoric impact basins, and then cooled.</p>
<p>Anorthosite, the highland rock, is believed
by many scientists to have formed
when the original crust of the Moon cooled
and solidified. According to this theory, a
light mineral, plagioclase, floated to the
surface of the Moon and formed the anorthosite.</p>
<p>Breccia, the shocked rock, is composed of
large and small fragments of rocks which
were shattered and redistributed on the
lunar surface by meteoric impacts. Subsequently,
the fragments were recombined
into new rocks by heat and pressure.</p>
<p>Lunar soils are largely composed of fragments
of the three types of rocks and their
minerals, and glass produced by meteoric
impacts and volcanic eruptions.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
